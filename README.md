# Galaxy-Classification-With-a-Convolutional-Neural-Network
Given images of different galaxies, this code should successfully classify the type of galaxy corresponding to each dataset/image that the user wants. The algorithm should also add some additional information about the picture that the user is looking at; for example, if the algorithm computes the type of galaxy, it should also add some additional information about the specific galaxy type.
