# Galaxy-Classification-with-LeNet-5
Given images of different galaxies (in this case Galaxy Zoo's dataset of around 18,000 images) as well as their 10 unique categories ('Disk, Face-on, No Spiral', 'Smooth, Completely round', 'Smooth, in-between round', 'Smooth, Cigar shaped', 'Disk, Edge-on, Rounded Bulge', 'Disk, Edge-on, Boxy Bulge', 'Disk, Edge-on, No Bulge', 'Disk, Face-on, Tight Spiral', 'Disk, Face-on, Medium Spiral', and 'Disk, Face-on, Loose Spiral'), this code should successfully classify the type of galaxy into their respective categories. I decided to pick up this project for fun and to learn more about Galaxy Zoo's mission in understanding the structures of different galaxies and how they're formed for the sake of understanding the nature and history of our universe.
